# Brest-cancer


# Goal of the Project:

We have extracted features of breast cancer patient cells and normal person cells. As a Machine learning engineer / Data Scientist has to create an ML model to classify malignant and benign tumor. To complete this ML project we are using the supervised machine learning classifier algorithm.

# 0 means malignant tumor


# 1 mean benign tumor



# XGBoost model accuracy is  98.24%
